Overview:

## Login Page

This is the login page with a design made using Tailwind CSS. I added a handy toggle button so you can easily switch between authorized and unauthorized users (assuming backend integration will handle authentication), ensuring you get access to the home page.

## Home Page

On the home page, each user can view their personal images. Additionally, there's a convenient 'Show All' button that allows users to toggle and explore images from all users. 

## All Users Images Page

On the 'All User Images' page, an added layer of privacy ensures images remain blurred, preventing users from opening them in a new tab (achieved by disabling pointer-events). Hovering over a specific image reveals a button to buy that Image. Clicking this button navigates the user to the Razorpay payment page, to access the full-resolution image.
